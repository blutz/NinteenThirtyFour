        <p>Information you input into this calculator is not saved. When you register for camp, we will ask for more details (e.g. case numbers and detailed income information).</p>

(For instance, if your camper goes to UniCamp and another summer camp, you will only be able to use the campership on <em>one</em> of those programs.)</p>
        <p>Additional DCFS-specific information (e.g. case number, case worker, and contact info) will be required on the UniCamp application and, if you choose to use the DCFS campership with UniCamp, will be submitted to DCFS for verification. If DCFS does not approve your campership, you will be required to pay the normal rates prior to attending camp.</p>
