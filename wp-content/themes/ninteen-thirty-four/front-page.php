            Classic UniCamp serves campers ages 10 - 14 and is our most traditional residential camp program. Campers have the opportunity to explore the outdoors and participate in traditional camp programs such as: archery, arts &amp; crafts, or rec. and also have the chance to push themselves with programs such as: the alpine climbing tower, sailing, or mountain biking. In addition to the traditional camp experience, each Classic UniCamp session partners with a Los Angeles area nonprofit or after-school program to address a specific social initiative. Throughout each camp session there will be special programs to address that weekâ€™s initiative.

            Speciality camps are available for campers ages 15 - 17 and are designed to push campers out of their comfort zone and challenge them to become leaders within UniCamp.  Participants are taught program specific skills and asked to take more leadership responsibilities around the campsite.
