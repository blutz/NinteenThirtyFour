   Pack some old clothes, grab a sleeping bag, put the family in the car, and join us for another amazing weekend at Camp River Glen. Hosted by UCLA UniCamp and itâ€™s student volunteers, Family Weekend is a chance to get away from the busy city, relax in nature, breathe fresh air, and share a camp experience with your family. UCLA UniCamp volunteers will staff program amenities of the campsite as you and your family can experience a traditional camp experience.
