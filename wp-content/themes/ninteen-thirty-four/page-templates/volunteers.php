    <h2>What is Woodsey?</h2>
    <p class='explainer'>
      The term Woodsey has come to mean a lot of things at UCLA UniCamp and most importantly it means family. When you are walking around campus and you see someone wearing a shirt that says Woodsey, you know that they are part of the UniCamp family. Even if you don’t know them you could stop them and talk to them about their session and ask how the kids were, and you can be guaranteed that they will stop and chat with you.
